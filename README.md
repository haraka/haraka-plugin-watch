Watch live SMTP traffic in a web interface.

![Watch Screen Capture](http://www.tnpi.net/internet/mail/haraka-watch.png)


## Enable Watch

1. Enable Haraka's HTTP server (see `listen` in http.ini)
2. Add 'watch' to config/plugins
3. Point your web browser at http://mail.your-domain.com/watch/

Enjoy the blinky lights.


## Tips

* Hover your mouse pointer or tap (with touch devices) on table data to see more
details.
* Copy that connection UUID at left and use it to grep your logs for even more.
* Edit the files in watch/html and play with the appearance. If you make it
  better, post a screen shot somewhere and create an Issue or PR.


## Interpretation Key

* Green: tests passed
* Light Green: tests passed, but with conditions
* Yellow: poor results, but not awful.
* Light red: tests failed, but no rejection
* Red: tests failed causing rejection

## Config

Config options are set in watch.ini.

* sampling: boolean, limit display connections to one-per-second
* wss.url: specify the WSS url (default: same scheme, host, port as http)
* wss.htdocs: an alternate docroot (default ./html)

## Troubleshooting

* If you aren't getting activity, make sure your web browser is able to establish the websockets connection. Either use straight http (only) or have a valid signed TLS certificate. The security for websockets connections is more strict than plain HTTP(s).
